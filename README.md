# weird_interviews
This is a repo mixing valuable and weird programming questions for software engineer and quantitative finance interviews. 

## Introduction
Interviews involving programming language related questions tends to become a mysterious mixture of two kinds of questions. One being the questions of common pitfalls when using a certain programming language (e.g., C++, Python); the other, annoyingly, are only designed to test whether you are wasting enough time to search for interview questions that makes the candidates more than qualified for a specific position. Worse, some interviewers doesn't understand the programming languages well so they tend to pick unnecessary questions. Having been tolerated by such circumstances, the author created the repo to save applicants time by providing high-frequent questions that appear in such interviews. 

## Contents
Currently the repo contains C++ and Python questions. 

## Call for pull requests. 
The author himself is not familiar with many popular languages (e.g., Java). Therefore he calls for pull requests contributing to this repo with other languages. On the other hand, the author welcomes further comments and polish on existing language types. Do share with us if you remember some absurd and weird interview questions that saves applicants time.
